In this lesson, we became familiar with a dataset stored in a SQLite table by learning how to craft basic SQL queries. The kind of queries we learned here and that well keep studying for the next few courses are one of four types of SQL commands we can give:

Data query language

Data definition language

Data control language

Data manipulation language

In this course and the next, well focus on data query language DQL. DQL is the part of SQL that allows users to extract data from databases. Data engineers use the remaining types of instructions to create and maintain databases.
